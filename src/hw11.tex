\subsection{Minimal spanning tree}
Prove or disprove the following statements. If true, give a short explanation. If false, give a counterexample.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected, undirected graph with a distinct cost $c(e)$ on every edge $e$. Suppose $e^*$ is the cheapest edge in $G$; that is, $c(e^*) < c(e)$ for every edge $e \neq e^*$. Then there is a minimum spanning tree $T$ of $G$ that contains the edge $e^*$.
\begin{solution}

\textbf{Definition I. }Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected, undirected graph with a distinct cost $c(e)$ for every edge $e\in E$.

\textbf{Definition II. }Let $e^*\in E$ be the cheapest edge in $G$; that is, we have $c(e^*)<c(e)$ for all $e\in E$ where $e\neq e^*$.

\textbf{Lemma I. }\textit{Claim. }Let $T=(V,E_T)$ be a spanning tree of $G$ where $e^*\notin T$. We can construct a spanning tree of $G$ whose total cost is less than that of $T$.

Since $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$, there exists a path $(u,\dots,x,y,\dots,v)$ in $T$ containing an edge $e'=\{x,y\}$ for $x,y\in V$. Of course, $e'\neq e^*$ since $T$ does not contain $e^*$.

We can add edge $e^*$ to $T$ to construct $T'=(V,E_T\cup\{e^*\})$, an induced subgraph of $G$. Now there exists a cycle $(u,\dots,x,y,\dots,v,u)$ in $T'$ that contains $e'$. Note that $T'$ is connected because $T$ is a tree, and thus connected.

We can construct $T''=(V,(E_T\cup\{e^*\})\setminus\{e'\})$, an induced subgraph of $G$ derived by replacing $e^*$ with $e'$ in $T$; that is, by removing $e'$ from $T'$.

After severing the edge $e'=\{x,y\}$, paths $(x,\dots,u)$ and $(v,\dots,y)$ still do exist in $T''$. Since edge $e=\{u,v\}$ does exist in $T''$, there exists a path $(x,\dots,u,v,\dots,y)$ in $T''$. All other vertices in $T''$ are connected because $T'$ is connected. So $T''$ is connected. 

Without $e'=\{x,y\}$, the cycle $(u,\dots,x,y,\dots,v,u)$ does not exist in $T''$. By construction, this is the only cycle in $T''$ since $T$ is a tree, and thus, acyclic. Thus, $T''$ is acyclic.

By construction of $T''$, the total cost of all edges in $T''$ is the total cost of all edges in $T$, minus the cost of $e'$, plus the cost of $e^*$. Since $c(e^*)$ is the cheapest edge in $G$, and $e'\in G$, we know $c(e^*)<c(e')$. Therefore, the total cost of all edges in $T''$ is less than that of all edges in $T$.

Since $T''$ is a connected, acyclic, induced subgraph of $G$ containing all vertices in $G$, we know that $T''$ is a spanning tree. $T''$ is a spanning tree of $G$ with a smaller total cost than $T$---what was to be constructed.

\textbf{Proposition I. }\textit{Claim. }There exists a minimum spanning tree of $G$ that contains $e^*$.

\textit{Proof. }Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists no minimum spanning tree of $G$ that contains edge $e^*=\{u,v\}$ for $u,v\in V$. Let $T=(V,E_T)$ be a minimum spanning tree of $G$. It follows from our hypothesis that $e^*\notin E_T$.

From Lemma I, since $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$ that does not contain its cheapest edge $e^*$, we can construct a spanning tree of $G$ whose total cost is less than that of $T$.

This is absurd: It contradicts the hypothesis that $T$ is a \textit{minimum} spanning tree of $G$. Ergo, the hypothesis is false: There does exist a minimum spanning tree of $G$ containing $e^*.~\square$
\end{solution}
\newpage
\item In the above setting, every MST of $G$ contains the edge $e^*$.
\begin{solution}
\textbf{Proposition II. }\textit{Claim. }Every minimum spanning tree of $G$ contains $e^*$.

\textit{Proof. }Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists some minimum spanning tree $T=(V,E_T)$ of $G$ where $e^*\notin E_T$.

From Lemma I, since $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$ that does not contain its cheapest edge $e^*$, we can construct a spanning tree of $G$ whose total cost is less than that of $T$.

This is absurd: It contradicts the hypothesis that $T$ is a \textit{minimum} spanning tree of $G$. Ergo, the hypothesis is false: Every minimum spanning tree of $G$ does contain $e^*.~\square$
\end{solution}

\subsection{Faster minimal spanning tree}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that all edge weights of the given undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ are promised to be $1$. Design the fastest algorithm you can to compute the minimum spanning tree (MST) of $G$. Argue the correctness of the algorithm and state its run-time. 
    
    \hint{It should be more efficient than the $O(|E| \log |V|)$ run-time of Prim and Kruskal.}
\begin{solution}

\textbf{Algorithm 1. }{\sc SpanningTree}($G$) with undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, returns a minimum spanning tree of $G$:

Let $T=(V,E_T)$ with $E_T\leftarrow\emptyset$.

If $V=\emptyset$, then return $T$.

Let $s\leftarrow v\in V$, choosing $s$ arbitrarily.

Perform {\sc DepthFirstSearch}($s,G$); here {\sc DepthFirstSearch} is the well-known depth-first-search algorithm that visits each vertex in a graph once beginning from a source $s\in V$ and assigning $u.\mathsf{parent}$ to some vertex $v\in V$ for each $u\in V\setminus\{s\}$. Note {\sc DepthFirstSearch} has running time $O(|V|+|E|)$.

For $v\in V\setminus\{s\}$, assign $E_T\leftarrow E_T\cup\{\{v.\mathsf{parent},v\}\}$, via adjacency list.

Return $T$.

\textbf{Proposition 1. }\textit{Claim. }{\sc SpanningTree}($G$) is correct.

\textit{Proof. }

\textbf{Proposition 2. }\textit{Claim. }{\sc SpanningTree}($G$) has running time $O(|V|+|E|)$.

\textit{Proof. }First, Algorithm 1 invokes {\sc DepthFirstSearch} with running time $O(|V|+|E|)$.

Then, for each of the $|V|-1$ vertices in $V\setminus\{s\}$, it inserts an edge into $T$ via adjacency list, an $O(1)$ operation. Thus, the running time of the loop is $O(|V|)$.

Finally, Algorithm 1 returns the resulting tree, an $O(1)$ operation.

Thus, the running time of {\sc SpanningTree}($G$) is $O(|V|+|E|)+O(|V|)=O(|V|+|E|).~\square$
\end{solution}
    \item Suppose instead that all edge weights are 1 \emph{except} for a single edge $e_0 = (u_0, v_0)$ whose weight is $w_0$ (note, $w_0$ might be either larger or smaller than 1). Show how to modify your solution in part 1 to compute the MST of $G$. What is the running time of your algorithm and how does it compare to the runtime you obtained in part 1 (or standard Prim)?
